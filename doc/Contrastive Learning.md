Given a dataset $X$ with $T_d$ points sampled from some unknown pdf $p_d$, we construct another dataset $Y$ with $T_n$ points sampled from some known pdf $p_n$.

Now we parameterize $p_d$ with $p_m(\cdot;\theta)$, so that
$$
p(u|C=1,\theta)=p_m(u;\theta)
$$

$$
p(u|C=0)=p_n(u)
$$

so the posterior probabilities are
$$
P(C=1|u;\theta)=
$$
